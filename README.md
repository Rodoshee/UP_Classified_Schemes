# EDA_UP_Schemes

In this file, we did an exploratory data analysis of the dataset obtained from "Cleaned_UP_Schemes",i.e,haq_final.

Here, you can find interactive datatables and bar charts exploring:

1. Basic Structure of the dataset.
2. Levels of all the categorical variables.
3. Share of each of the classification of the type of scheme in the total expenditure.
4. Compare the expenditure of each district on different types of schemes.
5. Identify schemes with expenditure of zero.
6. Identify the grant type with highest amount of expenditure.
7. Identify the observations(/schemes) with the highest and lowest expenditure.
8. Identify the observations(/schemes) with the highest and lowest allotment.
9. Explore the share of each of the mode of benefit of transfer in the total expenditure.
10. Compare the expenditure of each district on modes of benefit of transfer.


# Interesting Observations!?

1. There were a large number of schemes, whose expenditure amount was zero, but percentage of scheme utilisation was a positive number other than 0 (For example,60%)!
2. There were a number of schemes whose scheme allotment amount was negative !? 

These can be mistakes in data entry, but definitive issues that need to be flagged.
